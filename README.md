# BBCWinchesterPro

A PCB that combines a Raspberry Pi running [PiTubeDirect](https://github.com/hoglet67/PiTubeDirect) and a J.G Harston's [IDE Interface](https://mdfs.net/Info/Comp/BBC/IDE/), intended to emulate the 6502 2nd Processor and Winchester Hard Disk required to run a Level 3 Econet Fileserver on a BBC Micro Model B.

## Notes 

- It's currently untested, and the PCB will likely change in future.
- The board indicates the license is CC BY-NC-SA, however I've since discovered that derivatives must be licensed under the same terms. This will be fixed on the silkscreen in a future revision.

## License

- The [IDE interface](https://mdfs.net/Info/Comp/BBC/IDE/) was designed by J.G Harston and [sprow](http://www.sprow.co.uk/) and anyone is permitted to use the design with acknowledgement.
