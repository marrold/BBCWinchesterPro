# BBCWinchesterPro

A PCB that combines a Raspberry Pi running [PiTubeDirect](https://github.com/hoglet67/PiTubeDirect) and a J.G Harston's [IDE Interface](https://mdfs.net/Info/Comp/BBC/IDE/), intended to emulate the 6502 2nd Processor and Winchester Hard Disk required to run a Level 3 Econet Fileserver on a BBC Micro Model B.

**Note:** It's currently untested, and the PCB will likely change in future.

## FAQ

 - **Why is this licensed under CC BY-NC-SA?**
	 There's already several options available for sale from members of the BBC Computer     community and I have no intention of this project competing with theirs.
